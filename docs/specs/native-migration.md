# Johns on iOS and Android: migration plan

Status: **approved 25 October 2026**, with the recommended answer to each
question at the end. Written against `johns@e17afac` and
`app-template@f08512d`.

## What this does

Moves Johns onto the shape of `glynfinck/app-template` (an Expo app, a
Next.js API, a shared `@app/core` package and `supabase/`) so the same house
can be run from an iPhone, an Android phone and the web, without
johns.glyn.dev noticing on the way.

What does **not** change, in any phase:

- `supabase/`: RLS and the SECURITY DEFINER functions stay the only
  enforcement. Migrations stay additive. The native app writes through the
  same functions the web does.
- The clock: pg_cron, `request_tick()`, the Vault secrets, `/api/cron/tick`
  and its URL, `CRON_SECRET`.
- Web push: VAPID keys, `/sw.js`, the existing subscriptions.
- One backend: Supabase, with `apps/api` on Vercel beside it. Expo, Google
  and Apple only deliver what `apps/api` sends (decision 3).
- Ports: the app on 3205, Supabase on 54340–54344.
- Store releases: `release-targets.json` has `ios` and `android` set to
  `false`, and nothing here switches them on.
- Env var names in production (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*`,
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, `VAPID_*`). The template's
  names (`SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`) would mean
  editing Vercel's environment for no gain, so `apps/api` keeps Johns' names.
  `apps/client` gets new `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` names, which conflict with nothing.

For a Python reader: npm workspaces work like a uv workspace. `@app/core` is
a local package every app installs in editable mode (`pip install -e`), and
its `index.ts` re-exports the modules the way an `__init__.py` with
`from .week import *` would.

## Where it starts and where it ends

| | Johns today | Template | Johns after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Layout | one Next.js app at the root | `apps/client`, `apps/api`, `packages/core` | the template's layout |
| Pure rules | `lib/*.ts`, `tests/unit` | `packages/core/src` | `packages/core/src`, tests beside each file |
| Next.js | 16.2.10, pages and API | 16.4.3, route handlers only | 16.2.10 (no bump), pages kept until Expo web parity |
| React | 19.2.4 | 19.3.0 (Expo SDK 58) | one version, the Expo SDK's, from Phase 3 |
| Expo | none | SDK 58, RN 0.88 | SDK 58 (newest stable today, 58.0.19) |
| Tests | Vitest (unit, db), Playwright | Jest | Vitest in core and api, jest-expo in client, Playwright |
| Agent rules | `CLAUDE.md` + Next's `AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` only | `AGENTS.md` only |
| Releases | none | `release-targets.json`, `scripts/release.mjs` | the same, both off |

The finished tree:

```
apps/
  api/          Next.js: web UI (until parity), server actions, /api/* routes,
                the engine, push sending, e2e, tests/db         → Vercel "johns"
  client/       Expo: iOS, Android, web                         → EAS later; Vercel at parity
packages/
  core/         @app/core: week, deal, away, outcome, points, streak, stake,
                dispute, money, format, domain, errors, auth-paths, schemas,
                Bin Night tokens, db-types
supabase/       unchanged
scripts/        provision, tick, vapid, release.mjs
docs/specs/     this file, _template.md, one spec per later feature
release-targets.json   { "ios": false, "android": false }
```

### The map, file by file

| Today | After | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lib/{week,deal,away,outcome,points,streak,stake,dispute,money,format,domain,errors,auth-paths}.ts` | `packages/core/src/*.ts` | 1 |
| `types/database.ts` | `packages/core/src/db-types.ts` (`npm run types` still writes it) | 1 |
| `tests/unit/*.test.ts` (except provision) | `packages/core/src/*.test.ts`, same names | 1 |
| `tests/unit/provision.test.ts` | `scripts/provision/lib.test.ts`, run by the root `npm test` | 1 |
| `lib/config.ts`, `lib/utils.ts`, `lib/push.ts`, `lib/actions/`, `lib/data/`, `lib/engine/`, `lib/supabase/` | `apps/api/lib/` | 2 |
| `app/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `public/`, `proxy.ts`, `components.json`, Next/PostCSS/ESLint/TS configs | `apps/api/` | 2 |
| `tests/db/`, `tests/support/`, `e2e/`, `playwright.config.ts`, `vitest.config.mts` (db) | `apps/api/` (the db suite drives the engine, which lives there) | 2 |
| `.env.local`, `.env.example` | `apps/api/` | 2 |
| `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` | merged into root, `apps/api` and `apps/client` `AGENTS.md`; `CLAUDE.md` deleted | 2 (client file in 3) |
| zod inputs in `lib/actions/*` | `packages/core/src/schemas.ts`, one screen at a time | 5–11 |
| query shaping in `lib/data/*` | pure builders in core (rows in, view out), used by both apps | 5–11 |

The engine (`lib/engine/tick.ts`) stays in `apps/api`, not core: everything
it does goes through service-role SQL functions, and only a server holds that
key. It keeps taking the client and `now` as arguments, so `tests/db` still
drives it directly.

## What the native app needs a server for

The rule from the brief: `apps/client` calls Supabase directly (rpc, table
writes the column grants allow, Storage, Realtime) and calls `apps/api` only
where a server is genuinely needed. Going through every server action today:

| Move | Web today | Native and Expo web |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mark_done`, `undo_done`, `use_immunity`, `use_swap`, `confirm_payment`, `set_away`, `cancel_away`, `save_group`, `delete_group`, `set_member_role`, `remove_member`, `create_house`, `join_house` | server action → rpc | **rpc, direct** |
| House settings, the John list, your own name, reactions | server action → table write | **table write, direct** (same column grants) |
| Photo receipt | browser → `proofs` bucket | **Storage, direct** (same policies) |
| Live updates | Realtime on `events`, `assignments`, `disputes` | **Realtime, direct** |
| Default currency and time zone for a new house | Vercel geo headers | device locale (`expo-localization`) through `currencyForCountry` in core |
| Hand out this week's Johns | action runs the engine with the service role | **`POST /api/deal`** |
| Raise a dispute | action: rpc, then pushes to the ticker and voters, then a tick (a house of two decides at once) | **`POST /api/disputes`** |
| Cast a vote | action: rpc, then a tick (a majority decides at once) | **`POST /api/disputes/:id/votes`** |
| Catch the house up before showing it | `ensureFresh` on page load | **`POST /api/fresh`** when a screen gains focus, at most once a minute per house, as now |
| The clock | pg_cron → `/api/cron/tick` | unchanged |
| Reminders and alerts | web push from the tick and the dispute action | the same messages, also sent to phones through Expo's push service (decision 3) |

For the dispute and vote routes, the rpc itself still runs as the caller
(a client built from their bearer token), so the database decides exactly as
it does now; the route only adds what needs the service role. The server
actions and the routes call one shared function in `apps/api/lib/moves/`, so
web and native cannot drift apart. The routes copy the template's helpers
(`requireUser`, `json`/`error`, `preflight`, CORS for listed origins only)
and live under `/api/*`, because pages still share the namespace;
`proxy.ts`'s matcher stops refreshing cookie sessions on `/api/*`, which
bearer routes never read.

## Decisions

### 1. Test runner: keep Vitest; Jest only where Expo needs it

**Recommendation:** `packages/core` and `apps/api` stay on Vitest (unit and
db projects, configs moved unchanged). `apps/client` uses Jest with
`jest-expo`. Every workspace has a `test` script, so the root `npm test`
runs all of them and nobody needs to remember which runner is where.

Why:
- 121 unit tests (run today: all pass) and 58 database tests are on Vitest. The db project's
  settings carry the house rules (one fork, no file parallelism, `retry: 0`
  because "a retried RLS test is a lie", global setup); porting them to Jest
  is risk with no payoff.
- Core exports TypeScript source and depends on ESM-only `date-fns` v4.
  Vitest runs both natively; Jest needs `ts-jest` plus ESM transform rules.
- `jest-expo` is the one supported way to test React Native components (its
  preset mocks the native modules), so the client cannot use Vitest.

Cost: two runners in one repo. The root `AGENTS.md` says which is where, and
the template's Jest rule is rewritten to match. Rejected: all-Jest (churn in
the suites that guard production) and Vitest in the client (no native module
mocks).

### 2. Sign-in: native Google, Sign in with Apple on iOS, all through Supabase Auth

**Recommendation:**

| Platform | Buttons | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS | Sign in with Apple, then Google | `expo-apple-authentication` (native sheet; raw nonce to Supabase, SHA-256 of it to Apple via `expo-crypto`) and `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin`; both end in `supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken` |
| Android | Google | `@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` → `signInWithIdToken` |
| Web (Expo) | Google | `signInWithOAuth` with a redirect, as the web does now (no `/auth/callback` needed: supabase-js finishes PKCE in the page) |

All of it sits in `apps/client/src/api/auth.ts`, as the template requires.
Guideline 4.8 only binds the iOS app, so Apple is offered only there.

What it needs:
- **Google Cloud (manual, no API):** an iOS client and an Android client
  (the debug keystore's SHA-1 for development builds; EAS's or Play's
  signing key later) beside the existing web client. `npm run provision`
  prints what to paste, as it does for the web client today.
- **Supabase Auth (production, ask-first, via provision):** the Google
  provider's Client IDs become web, iOS and Android, comma-separated; "Skip
  nonce check" on, which Supabase's guide requires for native Google on iOS;
  `johns://**` added to the redirect URLs. Apple provider on with the bundle
  identifier as its client ID once the Apple account exists (native-only
  Apple needs no secret key).
- A development build. Both libraries are native code, so Expo Go cannot run
  them: `npx expo run:android` / `run:ios` locally.

Two edge cases worth designing for now:
- **Hide My Email splits people.** A housemate who joined on the web with
  Google and later picks Apple with a relay address becomes a second user
  with no house. The iOS sign-in screen says "Already in a house? Use the
  account you joined with", and linking a second identity
  (`linkIdentity`) is a later feature.
- **Apple sends the name once,** in the credential and not the token, so
  `handle_new_user` would fall back to the relay address's local part. On
  the first Apple sign-in the client writes `fullName` into
  `profiles.display_name`, which the existing column grant already allows.

Sign in with Apple cannot be tried on a device until there is an Apple
Developer account. It is built and unit-tested in Phase 4 and must be proven
on a device before `ios` is ever switched on.

### 3. Push: Expo's push service for iOS and Android, web push stays

**Decided 25 October:** real push on iOS and Android through Expo's push
service. Web push stays exactly as it is.

- The app gets an Expo push token with `expo-notifications`
  (`getExpoPushTokenAsync`, which needs the EAS project ID in `app.json`) and
  stores it in a new table, `push_tokens` (additive migration: `user_id`,
  `token` unique, `platform`, `created_at`; RLS identical to
  `push_subscriptions`; grants stated for every role including
  `service_role`). Signing out deletes the device's token.
- `apps/api/lib/push.ts`'s `Notify` fans out to both: web push with VAPID
  exactly as now, and Expo's push API (up to 100 messages a call, sent with
  an `EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN` so that only `apps/api` can send to Johns' tokens).
  `DeviceNotRegistered` deletes the token, as 404 and 410 do for web. The
  message keeps its `url` (`/week`), which Expo Router opens.
- The message builder, the batching and the pruning are pure functions with
  unit tests in `apps/api`. A deployment without Expo's token sends nothing
  to phones, as one without VAPID keys sends nothing to browsers. A missing
  `push_tokens` table also reads as "no tokens", because Vercel can deploy
  before Supabase does.

Expo delivers through Google and Apple, who only deliver for senders they
know, so this needs:
- **An Expo account and EAS project** (`eas init`). This is not a store
  account. Its access token goes only into `apps/api`'s Vercel environment.
- **A Firebase project, used only for its Cloud Messaging key.** Nothing of
  Johns is stored or run there. The Android app carries the project's
  `google-services.json` (identifiers, not secrets); the key is uploaded to
  Expo's credentials, not to Vercel.
- **Apple's push key**, from the Apple Developer account, uploaded to Expo
  too. Until it exists, iPhones get no notifications on a closed phone; the
  app shows everything when it's open.

### 4. Photo receipts: camera or library, same bucket, same rules

**Recommendation:** `expo-image-picker` offers "Take photo" and "Choose
photo" (on web it falls back to a file input). `expo-image-manipulator`
shrinks to 1600px on the long side as JPEG, matching the web, so uploads
stay under the bucket's 5 MB limit and its jpeg/png/webp types. The client
uploads to `proofs` at `<house>/<assignment>/<file>.jpg` with supabase-js,
then calls `mark_done(p_assignment, p_photo_path)`. The storage policies
(`can_upload_proof`) and `mark_done`'s `photo_path` check decide, as now.
The path builder and the resize sum move to core, so both apps use one copy.
Camera and library permission strings go in `app.json` through the plugin's
config, so a refusal is a sentence on screen, never a crash.

### 5. Bin Night in React Native

**Recommendation:**
- **Tokens:** the palette is already hex in `app/globals.css` (no oklch to
  convert). The values move into `packages/core/src/bin-night.ts` as plain
  data: light, dark, the six bin lids, hi-vis, hazard, radius. The client
  has **one theme file**, `apps/client/src/theme.ts`, that turns them into
  React Native styles (colours, Overpass weights, the heading style, spacing,
  48px controls). An `apps/api` unit test reads its own `globals.css` and
  fails if any `--token` differs from core, so the two can't drift while
  both ship. (The test sits in `apps/api` because apps may import packages,
  never the reverse.)
- **Type:** `@expo-google-fonts/overpass` in the weights the web uses
  (400–900), loaded behind the splash screen so nothing flashes. (The plan
  said the `expo-font` config plugin; see Phase 3 for why not.)
  A `Heading` component does the uppercase and the tracking, so screens
  never repeat it.
- **Signage:** the `road-sign` wordmark, `HazardTape` (diagonal stripes
  drawn with `react-native-svg`) on late and missed, `Lid` per kind of John,
  `StatusChip`. These are domain components, as they are on the web.
- **Icons:** `lucide-react-native`, reactions included.
- **No emoji:** a client test scans `src/` for `\p{Extended_Pictographic}`,
  so a stray emoji fails CI rather than code review.
- **Light and dark:** `userInterfaceStyle: "automatic"`; the theme follows
  `useColorScheme()`, as next-themes follows the system on the web.
- **Responsive:** tabs along the bottom on phones. On web from 1024px
  (Tailwind's `lg`) a sidebar, with the week board as a table; compact
  controls only there.

**This overrides two lines in the template's `apps/client/AGENTS.md`**
("native tabs, SF Symbols on iOS, Material on Android"). Johns uses
`expo-router`'s JS `Tabs` with lucide icons on every platform: a native tab
bar on iOS needs SF Symbols or bitmaps, which breaks "lucide icons only" and
the Bin Night look. What it gives up is the system tab bar's Liquid Glass on
iOS 26. The rewritten `apps/client/AGENTS.md` says this, so no later agent
"fixes" it. (Open question 3 if you'd rather have native tabs.)

### 6. Agent rules: AGENTS.md only

**Recommendation:** in Phase 2, when the paths change anyway, `CLAUDE.md` is
split up by where each rule applies, and then deleted:

| Goes to | What |
| --- | --- |
| root `AGENTS.md` | the template's root file with "About this app" filled in; the words (John, Johns, the Stake, the Table, the Wall, the deal; never "rota", never "chore app"); the game; the data model; "rules live in the lowest layer"; the clock; the test tiers and their rules; ports; deploys (never `supabase config push`, provision); monorepo rules; the ask-first list |
| `apps/api/AGENTS.md` | Next's agent-rules block (Next 16.2 doesn't regenerate it; 16.4's `next dev` would); Next 16 specifics (`proxy.ts`, Promise `params`, `refresh()`); shadcn and the house customisations; Bin Night on the web; the app shell; the engine; thin server actions; e2e rules (`gotoSettled`, counting what reads the same in every layout); the template's route rules for `/api/*`; and a dated exception: **this app keeps its pages until Expo web parity (Phase 13)** |
| `apps/client/AGENTS.md` (Phase 3) | Expo's block and the template's client rules, plus Bin Night in RN, the lucide/JS-tabs override, and "write through rpc; call apps/api only for the four routes above" |

`.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md` gets the new paths and commands, and
`.claude/settings.json` keeps its permissions and gains the template's
`expo@claude-plugins-official` plugin in Phase 3. After the merge I open a
fresh session to check the root `AGENTS.md` is actually loaded. If it isn't,
I stop and tell you rather than bring `CLAUDE.md` back.

### 7. Screen order

**Recommendation:** your order, with one addition: **sign-in, join (with
create house), today, week, wall, table, stake, house.** Someone who signs
in with no house and no join link needs "create house" to go anywhere, so it
ships with join.

Admin-only moves (dealing, editing the John list) arrive with House, last.
Until then a house is set up on the web and played on the phone: both
clients hit the same database, so that works from Phase 5. Push comes after
House (decision 3).

### 8. Other choices the plan makes

- **The restructure is two PRs** (Phases 1 and 2), not one. Moving the Next
  app into `apps/api` cannot deploy until Vercel's Root Directory changes,
  and that change should land alone in a PR that is nothing but moves.
  Phase 1 (workspaces and core) builds on Vercel exactly as today. This is
  open question 1.
- **Next.js stays on 16.2.10.** Nothing here needs 16.4, and a framework bump
  isn't a zero-change restructure. It can be its own PR later.
- **One React version** from Phase 3: the root `overrides` pin `react` and
  `react-dom` to what Expo SDK 58 expects (`npx expo install --check` gives
  the exact patch). Next 16.2.10 accepts `^19.0.0`, and the App Router
  renders with Next's own bundled React anyway, so the web app barely notices.
  CI checks `npm ls react` resolves to one version.
- **Metro on port 8205** (`expo start --port 8205`), beside 3205, so it never
  collides with another app made from the template on 8081.
  `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8205` locally.
- **Data fetching:** `@tanstack/react-query` in the client for caching,
  refetching on focus (`AppState`) and invalidating after a move; Realtime
  events invalidate the same queries, the way `live-refresh.tsx` calls
  `router.refresh()` now. Without it, every screen grows its own loading and
  refetch hooks.
- **Identifiers:** app name `Johns`, slug `johns`, scheme `johns`, bundle ID
  and Android package `dev.glyn.johns`. Bundle IDs are permanent once a store
  has seen them, so this is open question 2.
- **Join links:** `https://johns.glyn.dev/join/CODE` keeps working on the web.
  On a phone it opens in the browser until universal links and app links are
  set up, which need the Apple team ID and the release signing key, so it
  waits for the store accounts. Meanwhile the app takes `johns://join/CODE`,
  and the join screen also takes a typed or pasted code.

## Phases

Each phase is one PR off `main` and leaves lint, typecheck, unit, db, build
and e2e green. Every phase that touches the client ends with an exact list
of what to check on Android, iOS (simulator until the Apple account) and
web. "Production" says what the merge touches beyond an ordinary deploy;
anything listed there waits for your word in that message.

**Order from Phase 7 (decided 25 Oct):** the screens first, so the UI can be
iterated on. Phases 7–11 land one PR each, checked on the Expo web build and
merged once CI is green; the code stays cross-platform, but iOS- and
Android-only work waits until after Phase 11: Phase 12 (native push),
checking each phase on a simulator or emulator, native sign-in's client IDs,
and anything to do with the stores. Phase 13 (the cutover) is still asked
for step by step.

### Phase 1: workspaces and `@app/core` (zero behaviour change)

- Root `package.json` gains `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` and depends on
  `"@app/core": "*"`. The Next app stays at the root for this phase.
- `packages/core`: the 13 pure modules, `db-types.ts`, an `index.ts` barrel
  (no export-name collisions, checked), `package.json` (private, TS source,
  deps `date-fns`, `@date-fns/tz`, `zod`), `tsconfig.json`, its Vitest config
  and ESLint config, with `lint`, `typecheck` and `test` scripts.
- The unit tests move beside their modules unchanged. The provision test
  moves beside `scripts/provision/lib.mjs`.
- 32 files in the app and `tests/db` switch from `@/lib/<rule>` to
  `@app/core`, and 6 from `@/types/database`; imports inside core become
  relative.
- `next.config.ts`: `transpilePackages: ["@app/core"]`, plus whatever
  Turbopack's monorepo root needs according to `node_modules/next/dist/docs`.
- `npm run types` writes `packages/core/src/db-types.ts`; `npm run db:types`
  becomes the template's alias for it.
- `CLAUDE.md` and README path updates only; `docs/specs/_template.md` added.

Proof: the test files' diff is renames plus import lines (`git diff -M`
shows renames at ≥95% similarity), the same test counts pass, and `next
build` prints the same route table as `main`. The PR's Vercel preview
proves the workspace install on Vercel itself.
Production: an ordinary deploy.

### Phase 2: the Next app becomes `apps/api`; AGENTS.md only (zero behaviour change)

- `git mv` everything in the table above into `apps/api`. Its
  `package.json` takes the Next app's dependencies and scripts, with
  `--port 3205` kept. The root becomes a pure workspace root
  (`"workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]`) whose scripts delegate: `dev`,
  `build`, `start`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `test:db`, `test:e2e`,
  `types`, `tick`, `provision`, `vapid`, `db:start|stop|reset`.
- `.env.local` moves to `apps/api/.env.local`. The pinned Supabase CLI
  (2.114.0) turned out to read `env(AUTH_GOOGLE_*)` from the root's
  `.env.local` or `supabase/.env.local`, so the Google values move to
  `supabase/.env.local` (with a `supabase/.env.example`), and provision writes
  them there. CI sets them in the environment, so CI isn't affected.
- CI writes `apps/api/.env.local` and uploads `apps/api/playwright-report`.
- Provision writes the local Google client to `apps/api/.env.local` and gains
  a **read-only** check that the Vercel project's Root Directory is
  `apps/api` (decision unit-tested in `lib.mjs`). It never sets it.
- The `AGENTS.md` merge (decision 6); `CLAUDE.md` deleted; the verify skill,
  README and DEPLOYMENT.md updated.

**Cutover (ask-first; the only production setting the restructure
touches):**
1. PR green in CI. Its Vercel preview will fail while Root Directory is
   still the repo root. That's expected: there is no root app to build.
2. On your word: set Root Directory to `apps/api` (Vercel → johns →
   Settings → Build and Deployment). This doesn't redeploy anything;
   production keeps serving the current deployment.
3. Build the PR's **preview** again (Redeploy in the dashboard, or the next
   real push). It now builds from `apps/api`, which proves Vercel's monorepo
   install and build before production sees them.
4. Merge. Production builds from `apps/api`. Then check: `/signin` answers,
   the cron tick returns 200 (`npm run provision -- --check` does both and
   changes nothing, but it's on your list, so I'll ask), and a page load
   catches a house up.

If any push reaches `main` between steps 2 and 4, its build fails and the
live deployment keeps serving; a failed Vercel build never replaces
production. **Rollback:** Instant Rollback to the previous production
deployment (seconds), Root Directory back to empty, revert the merge.

### Phase 3: `apps/client` scaffold, one React version, the release gate

- `apps/client` from the template: Expo SDK 58, Expo Router in `src/app`,
  `src/api/supabase.ts` with the template's per-platform session storage,
  identifiers from decision 8, Johns' icons and a Bin Night splash.
- The theme (decision 5): tokens in core, `apps/client/src/theme.ts`, fonts,
  `Heading`, `Button` (48px), `Card`, `Wordmark`, `HazardTape`, `Lid`,
  `StatusChip`, and the shell (tabs or sidebar). The only screen is the
  signed-out landing page.
- Root: React `overrides`, `release-targets.json` with both `false`,
  `scripts/release.mjs` (verbatim) and `release:ios` / `release:android`,
  and `dev:client` on 8205. No `eas.json`, no store config.
- `apps/client/AGENTS.md`; the Expo plugin in `.claude/settings.json`.
- CI: a parallel `client` job (lint, typecheck, jest-expo, the emoji scan,
  `expo export -p web`, `expo-doctor`) and a one-React-version check. The
  `globals.css` drift test goes into `apps/api`.

Proof: the web's e2e passes on React 19.3; `npm run release:ios` refuses.
Production: none (`apps/client` isn't deployed anywhere yet).

As built, where it differs from the above:
- **Fonts load at runtime**, held behind the splash screen in
  `_layout.tsx`, instead of the `expo-font` config plugin. One code path
  covers web (which can't embed), Expo Go (which ignores config plugins)
  and native builds. Each weight is imported from its own path, so the
  bundle carries six fonts, not the package's eighteen.
- **The shell moves to Phase 5.** The only screen is signed out, so there
  is nothing to put in tabs yet; the shell arrives with the first signed-in
  screens.
- **The front door's words moved into core** (`copy.ts`), so both apps
  say the same thing, and the web's `GROUND` colours now come from
  `BIN_NIGHT` too.
- **CI:** the client's lint, typecheck and Jest (the emoji scan is a Jest
  test) run in `verify`, because the root scripts run every workspace. The
  parallel `client` job does the rest: one React, `expo export -p web` and
  `expo-doctor` (pinned).
- React Native Testing Library 14 (async `render`, Test Renderer instead of
  React Test Renderer) and TypeScript 6, which no longer loads every
  `@types` package, so the client's `tsconfig.json` names `jest` and
  `node`.

### Phase 4: sign-in

Decision 2, on all three platforms; the session survives a restart; sign
out. Local `supabase/config.toml` gets the Apple provider (off, `env(...)`
secret) and the `johns://**` redirect; `config.toml` stays local-only, as
ever. The Expo web e2e starts here: Playwright serves the static `expo export`
on 8205 beside the API on 3205, on the same four-row matrix. `e2e/auth.ts`
gains a variant that mints the session into localStorage instead of
cookies. Jest covers `auth.ts` with Supabase mocked, and the nonce helper.
Production (ask-first): Supabase's Google Client IDs, skip-nonce and redirect
URL, through provision. Google Cloud's iOS and Android clients are yours to
create (no API).

As built, where it differs from the above:
- **No `johns://**` redirect**, locally or in production. Native sign-in
  hands Supabase an ID token and never redirects, and an allow-listed custom
  scheme is one another app could claim. It comes back if a flow ever needs
  it. Local config gains `http://localhost:8205/**` for the web build.
- **Skip-nonce waits for iOS.** Supabase's guide now calls it a weakening of
  replay protection, needed only because Google's iOS sign-in signs a nonce
  the app can't see. Provision turns it on only once `config.mjs` has an
  iOS client; Android and the web don't need it. Apple's sign-in does carry
  a nonce (SHA-256 to Apple, the raw value to Supabase).
- **Client IDs live in `config.mjs`**, not secrets: they are public. One
  Android client per signing key, so `androidClientIds` is a list.
- **The Apple provider stays off locally** with `dev.glyn.johns` as its
  client ID and no secret (native sign-in needs none): there is nothing to
  sign the app with the capability until the Apple account exists.
- **Signed in, the app shows a placeholder Today** (your name and Sign out)
  until Phases 5 and 6. The front door gains the web's three ways in, all
  to sign-in, and the sign-in words move into core for both apps.
- **`app.config.ts`** adds Google's iOS URL scheme from
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID`; app.json can't hold it before the iOS
  client exists.
- **The e2e serves the export itself** (`e2e/serve-client.mjs`): `expo
  serve` 404s every path but `/` for single-page output.
- **Fixed from Phase 3:** a test in `src/app` was bundled into the app as a
  route. Screen tests now live in `src/__tests__/app`, and a test fails if
  anything but a screen lands in `src/app`.

### Phase 5: join and create a house, and the API foundation

- `apps/api`: the template's `requireUser` / `respond` / `cors` helpers,
  `POST /api/fresh`, and `proxy.ts` no longer matching `/api/*`. A db-tier
  test calls the route handlers directly: no token is 401, someone else's
  house is refused, and a second call within a minute doesn't tick.
- `apps/client`: no-house screen, `join/[code]` (the same path as the web's
  link), `johns://join/CODE`, create house with locale defaults.
- Core: `CreateHouse` and the join-code shape move into `schemas.ts`; the
  web's actions import them from there.

As built, where it differs from the above:
- **The API keeps Johns' env names** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, the anon
  key) rather than the template's, since production's Vercel environment
  already has them; the helpers are otherwise the template's. `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
  is local only for now: the Expo web build calls from 8205, and once it
  serves johns.glyn.dev (Phase 13) it calls from the same origin.
- **`POST /api/fresh` takes the house's id** and refuses (404) a house the
  caller's own RLS can't read; `ensureFresh` now says whether it ticked.
- **The no-house screen offers a code box** beside "Start a house": a link
  opened on a phone lands on the join screen, but a code read off another
  screen needs somewhere to go. The join screen signs you in in place, so
  the code survives sign-in; its route parameter is `joinCode`, because the
  web's Google redirect brings a `?code=` of its own.
- **A new house takes the phone's time zone** as it stands, with "change it
  later from House" (Phase 11), instead of a picker of every zone. Currency
  and the week's first day are chips.
- **The words for creating and joining a house move into core** for both
  apps (`NEW_HOUSE_COPY`, `JOIN_COPY`, `NO_HOUSE_COPY`, `CURRENCY_SYMBOL`).
- If the house can't be read at launch (offline), the app says so with "Try
  again", rather than showing "No house yet" to someone who has one.

### Phase 6: Today

Mark done and undo, photo receipts (decision 4), spending immunity, Realtime
invalidation, pull to refresh, catching up on focus. The Today/Week shaping
in `lib/data/week.ts` becomes a pure builder in core that the web loader also
uses, so the web's e2e also proves that refactor. e2e on Expo web: tick a
John with a photo (file chooser) and see its chip change.

As built, where it differs from the above:
- **The builder is `board.ts` in core** (`rulesOf`, `buildWeekBoard`,
  `todayView`, `isOpen`); the web's loader and the app both read rows and
  hand them to it. The app builds at the current minute, so a John turns
  "due soon" or "overdue" on screen without a read. Today's and the John
  card's words moved to core too (`TODAY_COPY`, `JOHN_COPY`,
  `NOT_DEALT_COPY`, `INVITE_COPY`), and the web uses them.
- **Decision 4's shared sums are `proof.ts`** (`proofSize`, `proofPath`,
  `PROOF_QUALITY`); the web's photo tick uses them as well.
- **Today in the app is your part of the week**: your Johns, how many are
  left, your streak and tokens, the tick (with or without a photo), undo,
  immunity, the invite while you're the only one in, and the not-dealt
  card. The web's Today also has the votes waiting for you, the week's
  Table, your share lately and your stake; those come with the screens that
  own them (votes need Phase 7's routes; the Table is Phase 9, the Stake
  Phase 10, time away Phase 11).
- **No tab bar yet**: Today is the only screen in a house, so the tabs (and
  the sidebar from `WIDE` on the web) arrive with Week in Phase 7. Sign out
  sits at the foot of Today until House has it.
- **Setting a house up stays on the web for now**: an admin's not-dealt card
  says so, until House (Phase 11) brings the John list and the deal.
- **Catching up on focus restarts a read already on its way** when the
  server did something: React Query would otherwise fold the new read into
  the old one, and the screen could show the house from before the tick.
- The invite uses the system share sheet, with the link selectable on
  screen for a browser that has none.
- The image picker and manipulator are native modules: a development build
  from before Phase 6 can't take a photo.

### Phase 7: Week

The board (cards on a phone, a table from `lg` on the web), raising a dispute
and voting via the two routes (`apps/api/lib/moves/` shared with the server
actions), swaps. db tests: in a house of two, a dispute decides at once
through the route; a vote can't be cast on your own John.

As built, where it differs from the above:
- **The routes and the web's actions share `lib/moves/disputes.ts`**: the
  caller's own `raise_dispute` / `cast_vote`, then the push and the tick as
  the service role. A refusal answers 403 (not yours) or 409 (not now) in
  `humanError`'s words; the reason's own problem is a 400 from core's
  `RaiseDispute` and `disputeProblem`, which the web's action uses too.
- **The tabs arrive here** (`src/app/(house)/`): Expo Router's JS tabs with a
  custom bar in the web's look, one tab per screen along the bottom of a
  phone, and from `WIDE` on the web a sidebar of signs with the house above
  and you below. The house is followed live once, in that layout, for every
  tab. Only Today and Week have tabs so far; each later screen adds its own.
- **Week** is the web's: four counts, then each housemate's cards on a phone
  or the house as one table from `WIDE`, with the open disputes beside it.
  Disputing and voting are on the cards and the table; Today gains the
  votes waiting for you. "Use your swap" trades through `use_swap`
  directly. Still to come on Week: the week's Table beside the board
  (Phase 9), who's away (Phase 11) and an admin's re-deal (Phase 11, with
  `POST /api/deal`).
- The words for all of it moved to core (`WEEK_COPY`, `DISPUTE_COPY`,
  `SWAP_COPY`, `SECTION_LABEL`, `SHELL_COPY`), and the web uses them.

### Phase 8: the Wall

Events, reactions (lucide), photos through signed URLs, live updates.

As built, where it differs from the above:
- **The Wall's sentences are core's** (`wall.ts`: `describeEvent` gives the
  words, with the person in bold, a tone and an icon's name), as are the
  reactions' names and which events take them; both apps draw them with
  their own lucide. The web's loader and the app read the same rows through
  `wallEvents`.
- **Reactions don't stream**: `supabase_realtime` publishes `events`, not
  `reactions`, so a housemate's reaction shows on your next read, as on the
  web. Your own shows at once.

### Phase 9: the Table

Standings for the week and the month, from core's `points.ts`.

As built, where it differs from the above:
- **Fair shares come too**, with streaks and perks, as on the web's Table.
  The sums the engine did inside `loadBalances` move to core
  (`recentBalances`, `balanceRows`), and the month's standings with them
  (`monthStandings`), so the engine, the web and the app add up the same
  rows the same way. The app reads the recent weeks' `week_shares`, which
  RLS already shows to the house.
- **The week's Table also sits beside the board** (beside it from `WIDE`,
  under the cards on a phone) and **on Today**, with your share lately, as
  on the web. Today's stake comes with the Stake (Phase 10).

### Phase 10: the Stake

The ledger, settle-up from core's `stake.ts`, "confirm received" through
`confirm_payment`.

As built, where it differs from the above:
- **The Stake is built in core** (`buildStake`): this month so far as if it
  ended now, what closed months left owing after payments, who pays whom,
  and the latest entries. It is the web's loader, moved, so both apps read
  `ledger` and `month_closes` and show the same sums.
- **Today gains "Your stake this month"**, as on the web.

### Phase 11: House

Settings and the John list (admins, via the column grants), groups, time away
(the calendar), members and roles, the invite (the system share sheet with
the link and the code), renaming yourself, signing out, and "Hand out this
week's Johns" through `POST /api/deal`. After this the phone can run a house
from nothing.

As built, where it differs from the above:
- **Two PRs.** The first (11a) is the John list, the deal, the house rules,
  the invite, who lives here, and you (renaming, signing out, leaving); the
  second (11b) is groups and time away.
- **The deal is `lib/moves/deal.ts`**, shared by the web's action and
  `POST /api/deal`. `deal_week` is the engine's (service role only), so the
  move checks, through the caller's own session, that they're an admin of
  that house; db tests prove a stranger and a housemate are refused (403)
  and a week with a tick in it can't be re-dealt (409).
- **The forms' rules and words are core's**: `HouseSettings`, `JohnDraft`
  and `DisplayName` in `schemas.ts` (the web's actions validate with them
  too), `JohnDef`, `johnDef`, `NEW_JOHN` and `weeklyEffort` in `board.ts`,
  `moneyInput` in `money.ts`, and `HOUSE_COPY`, `JOHN_LIST_COPY`,
  `DEAL_COPY`, `RULES_COPY`, `MEMBERS_COPY` and `ME_COPY`, which the web's
  House now uses unchanged.
- **The time zone is typed, with "Use this phone's"** beside it when the
  phone is somewhere else, rather than a picker of every zone; the database
  refuses one it doesn't know. The web's selects are chips.
- **House reads the house again each time it comes into view**: the rules,
  the list and the members aren't on Realtime, and a tab stays mounted.
- **An admin can deal from Today and re-deal from Week**, as on the web, and
  Today's not-dealt card points at House instead of at the web.
- **Groups and time away (11b)** read and write as the web's do (`save_group`,
  `delete_group`, `set_away`, `cancel_away`), with their rules and words in
  core: `GroupDraft` and `AwayDraft` in `schemas.ts`, `GroupDef`/`groupDef`
  in `board.ts`, `awayPeriod`, `isoDayOf`, `awayThisWeek` (Week's "Away
  21–23 Oct"), `monthGrid` and `shiftMonth` in `away.ts`, and
  `GROUPS_COPY` and `AWAY_COPY`, which the web now uses too.
- **Time away is booked from a calendar the app draws** (a month of days:
  tap the first, then the last), not the web's two date fields: there's no
  date input on a phone without a native module, and this one is the same
  on iOS, Android and the web. Today gains the web's away banner, and Week
  says under each person which days they're away (with someone away and
  holding no Johns shown too) and lists them beside the laptop board.
- **Signing out moves from Today's foot to House.** Reminders on this
  device (web push) and the Day/Night/Auto choice stay on the web for now:
  native push is Phase 12, and the app follows the system's theme.

### Phase 12: native push

Decision 3. First a db test pins what the tick sends today (no test covers
reminders yet): which stage, when, and never twice. It must still pass, with
web push unchanged, once `Notify` fans out. Then the `push_tokens` migration
(revoking and granting as the house rules say) with db tests: you see and
remove only your own tokens; a housemate can't insert a token for you; the
service role reads them. Unit tests for the Expo messages, batching and
`DeviceNotRegistered` pruning. The app asks for notification permission from
House (never on first launch), registers its token, and opens the message's
`url` when tapped. Android is checked on an emulator with Google Play; iOS
waits for Apple's key.
Production (ask-first): the migration reaches the database through Supabase's
GitHub integration if it's on by then, otherwise through provision (`db
push`); the Expo account and EAS project; the Firebase project, which you
create in Google's console, and its key uploaded to Expo; `EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN`
put into Vercel by provision; later Apple's key, uploaded to Expo.

### Phase 13: web parity and the hosting cutover

Parity means every Playwright spec has a twin that passes against Expo web
on all four rows, plus a manual pass on phone and laptop, light and dark. Then
Expo web takes over johns.glyn.dev. My recommendation for that, to settle at
the time:

- A second Vercel project, `johns-web` (Root Directory `apps/client`, the
  template's `vercel.json`), takes `johns.glyn.dev`.
- Its `vercel.json` rewrites `/api/:path*` to the `johns` project, which gets
  its own hostname. The tick URL in Vault doesn't change, the web needs no
  CORS, and no secret is touched. The alternative is `api.johns.glyn.dev`
  plus a Vault update to `johns_tick_url`, which is cleaner but touches the
  clock.
- `apps/client/public/sw.js` stays at the same path and scope with the same
  VAPID public key, so existing web push subscriptions keep working.
- Everyone signs in once more on the web, because the session moves from
  cookies to localStorage.

Production (ask-first, all of it): the new project and its `EXPO_PUBLIC_*`
env, the domain move, Supabase's site URL and redirect URLs.

### Phase 14: `apps/api` goes headless

Once the domain has served Expo web for a while without a rollback: remove
the pages, components, shadcn, Tailwind and the server actions, and
`apps/api` becomes route handlers only, as the template intends. The cookie
e2e suite retires; the Expo web suite carries on.

## Ask-first, in one list

| Phase | What | Who |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Vercel Root Directory → `apps/api`; preview redeploy; merge; read-only provision check | you, or me through the Vercel connector on your word |
| 4 | Supabase Auth: Google client IDs, skip nonce, `johns://**` (via provision) | me on your word; Google Cloud clients are yours |
| 12 | the `push_tokens` migration; the Expo account and EAS project; the Firebase project (yours to create) and its key uploaded to Expo; `EXPO_ACCESS_TOKEN` into Vercel through provision; later Apple's key | you, or me on your word |
| 13 | new Vercel project, domain, Supabase site and redirect URLs; Vault only if you choose the subdomain | you, or me on your word |
| any | `npm run provision`, `supabase db push`, a production deploy, Vault, VAPID, `release:*`, `eas build --profile production`, `eas submit`, `eas update` | never without your say-so in that message |

## Risks

- **Vercel builds the whole workspace:** installing Expo and React Native for
  the API's build costs time. Measure it in Phase 3's preview; scope the
  install from `apps/api/vercel.json` if it hurts.
- **Two React toolchains in one `node_modules`** (Next and Metro), with
  `legacy-peer-deps=true` hiding peer conflicts. `expo-doctor` and the
  one-React check in CI catch most of it.
- **Apple accounts split from Google ones** (decision 2). The sign-in copy
  covers it for now; identity linking is a later feature.
- **iOS can only be checked on a simulator** until the Apple account exists,
  which means a Mac. Sign in with Apple and iOS push can't be proven before
  then.
- **CI time roughly doubles** once the Expo web e2e runs on the full matrix.
  The client job runs in parallel; the two e2e suites share one Supabase
  start.
- **AGENTS.md loading:** the template's premise is that Claude Code reads
  AGENTS.md when there's no CLAUDE.md. Checked in a fresh session in
  Phase 2.

## Questions, answered

1. **The restructure as two PRs** (Phases 1 and 2), so the Root Directory
   change lands alone? **Yes.**
2. **Identifiers:** `dev.glyn.johns` for the iOS bundle ID and Android
   package, `johns` as the URL scheme? **Yes.**
3. **Tabs:** JS tabs with lucide everywhere, or native tabs with SF Symbols
   and Material icons? **JS tabs with lucide.**
4. **Phase 2's switch:** will you flip Root Directory in the dashboard, or
   should I do it through the Vercel connector when you say so? **Me,
   through the connector, when you say go.**
5. **A Mac for the iOS simulator?** **Yes**, so iOS is checked on the
   simulator until the Apple account exists.
6. **Accounts in Phase 12:** OK to plan on an Expo account and a Firebase
   project then (neither is a store account)? **Yes**, for push through
   Expo's service. The Firebase project is used only for Android's delivery
   key (decision 3).

## Done when

- [ ] iOS, Android and web each sign in, join or create a house, and play
      every screen.
- [ ] johns.glyn.dev has served throughout, with the clock ticking and web
      push arriving.
- [ ] `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run test:db` and
      both e2e suites pass from the root.
- [ ] `release-targets.json` is still `{ "ios": false, "android": false }`.
