/**
 * Steady weeks: the deal with a points budget, in Smart or Classic mode.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic, one week at a time. The engine (apps/api
 * lib/engine/tick.ts) hands it every John on the list, who shares each one
 * and who can do it this week, each housemate's balance, preferences and the
 * days they're home, Classic's orders of turns from last week and which Johns
 * are waiting; it hands back who gets what, on which day, which Johns wait,
 * and the orders of turns for next week. Same inputs, same week, on any
 * machine. steady-run.ts runs it week after week for the tests and for the
 * budget sheet's "how often each John comes round".
 *
 * The rules (docs/specs/steady-weeks.md has them with the reasons):
 *
 * Shared by both modes:
 *   - Order. Missed Johns coming back go first, then Johns that keep their day
 *     or are done together, then Johns that have waited FRONT_WEEKS (longest
 *     first), then the rest by how late they are for their own schedule:
 *     weeks since their last turn ÷ how often they come round. With no limit
 *     everything due goes out, so the rest go biggest first, as fairShares
 *     always has.
 *   - The budget. Everyone home is owed one John of their own, even one
 *     bigger than their budget. After that a John goes to someone only if it
 *     fits. Johns that keep their day, and Johns done together, always go out
 *     and count toward the budget, but don't use up anyone's one John; a
 *     missed John coming back does.
 *   - Waiting. A John that doesn't fit waits for next week. It merges with
 *     its next turn, so it never doubles up, and it's never skipped.
 *   - Days. A John that keeps its day stays on it, on call is all week, and
 *     the rest go to the nearest free day that suits the person, then the
 *     nearest free day, and only then a day that already has one.
 *
 * Smart:
 *   - A target each: the budget, plus up to half again for someone behind
 *     the house's average balance, or minus up to half for someone ahead.
 *     More than a week's budget ahead is a week off.
 *   - One each first. The most overdue Johns go out, one for each person
 *     still owed one; whoever is furthest behind chooses first and takes the
 *     biggest ("rather do" counts a point bigger, "rather not" a point
 *     smaller). A group's John that nobody still to choose could do goes to
 *     the one choosing.
 *   - Never twice running, unless they'd rather do it, they're half the
 *     budget or more behind, or it has waited two weeks.
 *   - The rest, most overdue first, to whoever has the most target left and
 *     room for it. After a week waiting a John may go half the budget over
 *     someone's target; after two, back to whoever did it last time.
 *   - With no limit, today's deal (deal.ts fairSharesExplained): furthest
 *     behind, 1.5 against doing it last time, nobody past half as much again
 *     as their share while someone else could take it, except that
 *     someone's first John always gets past that cap.
 *
 * Classic:
 *   - Each John has its own order of turns, planned when the house picks
 *     Classic (or the John is added) so each week's points split evenly.
 *     Someone new joins the back of every order they share.
 *   - The John goes to the next person in its order who is home. Away or
 *     full, the next person in line with room does it, and they stay first.
