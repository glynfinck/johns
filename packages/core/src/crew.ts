/**
 * Shared Jonz: Johns done together, and help on any John.
 *
 * The one rule: a John's points are shared evenly by everyone who did it.
 *
 * A John's "Done by" (johns.crew) is 1, 2 to 6, or 0 for everyone home; its
 * points are per person. The deal hands a Together John out as one place per
 * person, linked by a job (assignments.job_id), so in the week's shares a
 * 3-person garden tidy at 4 points counts as 12.
 *
 * Whoever ticks a John says who did it: the roll call. It settles every open
 * place of the job at once. Everyone on it shares the points of those places,
 * helpers included (2-point bins done with help is 1 each); a holder left
 * off it has a miss once it stands, and their part goes to whoever did the
 * job, as a cover's does. Someone away keeps their place excused; if they
 * turn up anyway, that place's points join the share.
 *
 * The database does the same (supabase/migrations/20261031100000_shared_jonz.sql:
 * roll_call, house_balances); this is that rule for the screens: the
 * Table's credit (tableInputs), the roll call before it's sent
 * (rollCallPlan), and the words.
