/**
 * Fair shares: who gets which John this week.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic. The engine hands it the week's Johns (who shares
 * each one, and which of them are home on the day it is due), each
 * housemate's balance from every week so far, and their share of this week; it
 * hands back assignments. Same inputs, same deal, on any machine, which is
 * what lets a test pin it.
 *
 * What a share is (weekShares):
 *   - A John is split equally among the people who share it: the whole house,
 *     or the group it belongs to. Three on the upstairs bathroom owe a third
 *     each; two on the downstairs one owe half each.
 *   - Someone away on the day it is due is never handed it, but still owes
 *     their part, times the house's make-up rate (in full, half or none). The
 *     rest is split among the sharers who are home.
 *   - If nobody who shares it is home, it is skipped this week.
 *
 * A balance is the work someone did minus their share, over every week
 * they have lived there (carryOver). It never forgets a week: a balance that
 * dropped old weeks would drop a debt just as it was being paid back, and
 * the weeks spent catching up would then make the person look ahead. A John counts for whoever did it: done or late, for its
 * holder; covered, for whoever covered it; skipped with immunity or excused,
 * for its holder, since that's the house letting them off. A missed John
 * counts for nobody, so it comes back to whoever missed it in the next
 * deals, and covering for someone means you're dealt less later. Away is not
 * a holiday from your share: it shows up as a balance below zero, and the
 * weeks after hand you a little more until it evens out.
 *
 * Who gets what (fairShares), in order of what matters:
 *   1. Balances even out. Each John goes to whoever, of those home to do it,
 *      would be furthest behind: their balance, plus this week's Johns so far,
 *      minus their share of this week.
 *   2. Catching up is gradual. Nobody is handed more than half as much again
 *      as their share while someone else could take the John (CATCH_UP_PACE).
 *   3. Variety. Doing the same John as last time costs a small penalty, so
 *      the bathroom moves around when balances are close.
 *   4. Spread: ties go to whoever has fewer Johns this week. Then a seeded
 *      shuffle, so ties do not always fall the same way.
