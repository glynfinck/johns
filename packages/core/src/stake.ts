 * The Stake.

 * a late John forfeits a little, a missed one more, and nobody can lose more
 * than their stake in a month. Whatever is forfeited is shared equally among
 * the rest of the house.
 *
 * Only the differences ever change hands, so the app never asks anyone to pay
 * the stake in up front. It keeps an append-only ledger instead, in minor
 * units (pence, cents) and from each person's side: negative means they owe,
 * positive means they are owed. A balance is a sum of entries, never a stored
 * number, and a month's entries always sum to zero.
 *
 *   forfeit     written as each late or missed John is settled (negative)
 *   cap_refund  at month end, gives back anything forfeited beyond the stake
 *   share       at month end, each person's cut of everyone else's forfeits
 *   payment     when a payee confirms money arrived: +payer, −payee
