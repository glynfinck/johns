/**
 * The Stake.
 *
 * Everyone stakes the same amount each month. Finishing your Johns keeps it;
 * a late John forfeits a little, a missed one more, and nobody can lose more
 * than their stake in a month. Whatever is forfeited is shared equally among
 * the rest of the house.
 *
 * Only the differences ever change hands, so the app never asks anyone to pay
 * the stake in up front. It keeps an append-only ledger instead, in minor
 * units (pence, cents) and from each person's side: negative means they owe,
 * positive means they are owed. A balance is a sum of entries, never a stored
 * number, and a month's entries always sum to zero.
 *
 *   forfeit     written as each late, missed or covered John is settled
 *               (negative); a covered John's names its coverer as the
 *               counterparty
 *   cap_refund  at month end, gives back anything forfeited beyond the stake
 *   share       at month end, each person's cut of everyone else's forfeits,
 *               plus the whole of any forfeit for a John they covered
 *   payment     when a payee confirms money arrived: +payer, −payee
