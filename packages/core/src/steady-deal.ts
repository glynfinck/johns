/**
 * The Monday deal in Steady weeks: what the engine reads about a house, made
 * into one week of steadyWeek, and its answer made into assignments with due
 * times. Pure: the engine (apps/api lib/engine/tick.ts) reads the rows and
 * writes the result through deal_week, and this decides everything between.
 *
 * Days here are places in the house's own week (1 its first day … 7 its
 * last), so "nearest day" never wraps across a week that starts on a Sunday.
 * Fresh starts: a week dealt part-way through (the house's first deal, or an
 * admin's re-deal) only uses the days still to come, today included, and a
 * John that keeps its day whose day has gone sits this week out; someone who
 * moved in after the week was first dealt starts the next Monday, at a
 * balance of 0 (dealtMembers).
