 * Steady weeks, week after week: a house run forward through steadyWeek, with
 * everything that happens between deals (time away, misses, covers, excused,
 * swaps, people moving in and out, an admin's changes) and the balances they
 * leave. Pure and deterministic, like the deal itself.
 *
 * Two uses. The tests run the fixed houses in steady-houses.ts through it for
 * up to three years and check every week against the rules (steady-checks.ts).
 * The budget sheet runs a house's own list forward (comesRound) to say how
 * often each John will really come round on each budget.
 *
 * A John's schedule is the list's own (repeat.ts): every N weeks from a week,
 * or every N months on a weekday of the month. Weeks are counted from 1, the
 * week that starts on `startsOn`.
