 *
 * A cover is a tick by a housemate instead of the assignee (`coveredBy`).
 * It is checked like any tick and, once it stands, settles as `covered`
 * rather than done or late.

 * A place on a Together John that its roll call left off (`absentAt`) is
 * checked with that roll call and, once it stands, settles as missed. It
 * shows as missed from the moment of the roll call, as a cover shows as
