 * its house is empty, as `house_by_code` treats them).
 *
 * A link-preview bot has no session, and `house_by_code` answers only a
 * signed-in caller, so this reads with the service role. It reads exactly
 * what that function would show anyone who signs in with the link, and
 * nothing else. Never throws: a card has to be drawn even when the database
 * can't be reached, or the chat shows a broken preview.
