/**
 * Stripe's word on a House Pass purchase, carried to the house: the webhook
 * (app/api/stripe/webhook) calls this with each event it has checked the
 * signature of. A subscription is always read again from Stripe rather than
 * taken from the event, so events arriving late or out of order still land
 * on how things stand now. The rules are @app/core's (passAfterSubscription).
 *
 * Staging and production can share a Stripe sandbox, and each has a webhook
 * on it, so both hear every purchase. A purchase carries the stage it was
 * made on (lib/moves/pass.ts) and only that stage acts on it; one from
 * before stages were tagged belongs to whichever copy has its house.
 *
 * Returns what it did, for the logs and the tests.
