 * TextButton, a Segmented). Week's person header adds `leading` (a 24pt
 * Avatar) before the label and `tag` (a quiet Chip, "Swap ready") after it.
 *
 * The label keeps its width: Meta on the right gives way first, moving under
 * the label when the line can't hold both, and only then truncating. A
 * control hangs over the label's line, above and below it, so the group
 * starts LABEL_GAP below the label under every header alike. Its last few
 * points rest on the group's top edge, as the kit's do, so the header is
 * drawn over the group: the control is seen whole and keeps its whole
 * target. Sections don't space themselves: the Screen, or a flush Sheet,
 * holding them puts SECTION_GAP between its children.
