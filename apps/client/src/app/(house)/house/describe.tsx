 * The chat with Jonz as a page, on a phone or a tablet (from WIDE the same
 * chat opens as a panel beside the page instead: AskPanel). For a new house
 * it's Describe your house, pushed from Today's setup card and the empty
 * John list: Jonz (Claude, or a starter list when Claude isn't there)
 * drafts the Johns. For a house with a list it's Ask Jonz, from the
 * sparkles in the title bar: Jonz changes the list (a House Pass extra).
 * Either way an admin applies what they want. Not a HousePage: the chat
 * scrolls over a message box that stays put above the keyboard.
